# Managed.Reflection

Managed.Reflection is a fully managed replacement of System.Reflection and System.Reflection.Emit. Unlike System.Reflection, it is not tied to the runtime it is running on.

It targets .NET Standard 1.3, which means it runs on .NET Core 1.0 and .NET Framework 4.6.1 and up.

It can generate .pdb files in Portable PDB format.
